    "First things first, I do not know how this story will end. Yes, I’ve lived it, yes I will live it, but there is no ending. There will be no conclusion or moral of the story here because, as you will come to see here, morality will be as grey and ambiguous and ever-changing as it always has been and always will be. This recount will have no ending for as long as I hold this pen in my hand and blood runs through my veins. My point here, I guess, is to have no expectations. I will simply recount –with artistic freedom and a smidge of creativity filling the gaps, God willing– what has happened in my life thus far. And I shall try, to the best of my abilities, to be as genuine as possible, even if not entire “truthful” (again, a grey and ambiguous term). Now I’m sure you, dear reader, are wondering what all this is about. In one simple yet complex (grey and ambiguous) word: sex. But keep in mind that this will not be a sensationalized romance novel with explicit details on carnal pleasures and whatnot. Nor will this story be some academic analysis on the nature of the reproductive world of human beings. I stress, this is simply a story in which I will try to recount all I’ve been through and all I’ve learned through the few years (but many, many instances) of experiences that I have had the privilege to experience. I hope in doing so I will not only be able to remember my rather unconventional youth (already I hemorrhage memories to no end), but perhaps, if all goes well, to normalize sex once more to a world that has forgotten what it really is and how we as humans experience it. Sex has become an institution (either sensationalized or shunned or persecuted), and that, as I will try to vehemently prove, is bullshit. For many, Freudian fanatics above all, sex is related to the family and the development of sexual psychology starts at a very young age. Despite all of Freud’s own bullshit, that theory, I do believe, is true. At the very least for me if no one else. For me, my early childhood (ages 2–4 or 5) was as normal as the next child’s except for the fact that I moved around quite a bit. I made friends, I marveled at the simplest and most quotidian of things, I believed with utter certainty that the world was perfect, not understanding that there was a world outside the realm of perfection (another grey and ambiguous idea). Truly a child’s mind. Perfection was the only thing that existed, for there is nothing purer than a “normal” child’s mind, objective in its intentions yet subjective in its feelings of wonder at the world. At the age of 5, I discovered masturbation. Mind you, it took me seven more years to understand the implications of what I had been doing the whole time in the modern institution of sex; but for seven blissful years (sex-wise), I was completely unaware of the stigma surrounding this physical pleasure I had discovered within myself. Of course, near the end of these seven years, I began to learn what sex and masturbation was, but it took me a while to connect the dots. Those were the best seven years of sexual experience I have ever had, and perhaps ever will have; there were no conscious or subconscious feelings of guilt and disgust or pride and vanity that generally come with the introduction of such acts, for indeed there were no outside introductions instructing me on how to feel about these things. It was an internal discovery shared only by myself, my hand, and my clitoris. No expectations, no hopes, no want for more. What happened after this introduction of the institution of sex to my psychology was a hiatus of pleasure that occurred from the ages of 12 and 17 (the age I first experienced sex as most would define it). Mind you, I didn’t stop masturbating during this hiatus; in fact, it increased with frightening frequency and speed, and frighteningly decreased in intensity and satisfaction. It became an unhealthy coping mechanism to deal with my increasingly muddy and complicated world. In search of the purity of pleasure I had experienced as a child, I had instead found numbness, which at the time I happily accepted for I would have accepted almost anything to stop feeling how ugly, muddy, and grey and ambiguous the world (and/or my perception of it) had become. But all that comes later. After realizing what I was doing, the pleasure I had come to love and find comfort in became dirty in a sense; it had lost its innocence and with it the privilege of not experiencing guilt. This is the difficult part to explain because it wasn’t exactly outright guilt as you are probably imagining it; for I do remember precisely the moment my mind made that connection between what I was doing and what I was learning from health class and television, and I remember with a strange intensity trying to attach the feeling of outright guilt to my actions, and after some thought, consciously emotionally rejecting it as bullshit. But again, that explanation shall come later; I must first detail the happenings of the beginning and for that I shall try my best to remember the first day I masturbated. The exact day I discovered masturbation cannot be dredged from my wretched memory; how it happened remains as much a mystery to me as it is to you. Perhaps I was scratching an itch, perhaps I had leaned against the edge of a table or a chair; we shall never know. First and foremost, I must tell you that all of my memories are rooted in emotions, so all I can say truthfully (at least with any amount of sentimental authority) is that the beginning was pleasant, soft, and uneventful. It was to me as wondrous and mundane as the other things I began to experience at that age (school, friends, ice cream bars in the shape of Spiderman, etc.). I can also provide you with the images equating porn for the mind of a 5-year-old girl. I remember lying in my parents’ bed, thinking about Superman, and kissing a pillow in simulation (probably imagining a reenactment of a scene from a movie or a cartoon). The image that really spoke to me though, was the scene from Toby McGuire’s Spiderman where he kisses Mary Jane with half his mask off and hanging upside down. Perhaps it was something about the gentle and sensual way she lifted his mask to kiss him; to me at the time, it was probably something adults would equate to a striptease. It fascinated me to no end and always, very quickly, brought me over the edge. Did I feel lust? No, I do not believe my 5-year-old self was capable of that miserable, insanity-inducing feeling. But pleasure? Always. I think due to the unusual circumstance of an upside-down kiss (the anonymity, the inability to resist love, the fleeting nature of it), my sexuality later manifested itself in stranger and more taboo kinks, most well-defined by the feeling of bittersweet poignancy mixed with a bit of tender frustration. As I consumed more pop culture, the feelings of fascination at something novel would sometimes turn into desire. I would be shocked yet fascinated, and upon thinking about the images later, I would become turned on. Some images include various glimpses from the 1999 movie Eyes Wide Shut on HBO, the scene in the 1997 film Batman and Robin where Robin kisses Poison Ivy and Batman is bound in her vines, and the 1993 film The Piano where a man emerges naked as the protagonist plays the piano. These films influenced my dreams later. I digress. My point is that sexual pleasure (and some kinks) for me had never had that negative social taboo inherently associated with my cultures. So, unlike my peers, my first sexual experience was as innocent and mundane as finding out I could wiggle my ears and had the same pleasure as eating a new flavor of ice cream. For most, they would have to navigate and deconstruct the hush-hush aspect of sex first. For me, I had nothing to deconstruct at first; so, at the age of five, it became an inherent part of my construction of the world. I write about this now because I am trying to set the context for, or even possibly explain, where all this deviancy that I consciously chose later in life comes from. Why am I now the way that I am? Especially considering how moderately conservative I had been raised. Now back to infant masturbation. I guess there’s not much research on this due to moral issues (and rightfully so), so I will try to describe in explicit detail what that was like. I promise no precise scientific accuracy in my recount… after all, it’s been a few years and my memory is shit. Let’s set a basis here. Masturbation has been scientifically proven to exist amongst infants; that is no secret. In the beginning and middle, until the age of 16, there was no direct contact with my clitoris. It was always through my underwear. And in the beginning, up until I was 13, there wasn’t always continuous physical stimulation. During these moments, in order to orgasm, I would tense up my body and keep my hand where it was (usually with the edge of my thumb and my palm applying steady pressure on my clit). This was all before I knew what sex was. The images from the films mixed with my dreams and my conscious imaginings were all almost contactless between characters, the most amounting to a kiss. I did, however, have strange dreams that I would later alter with my conscious imagination to masturbate to, involving BDSM and humiliation. BDSM occurring after the bondage scene in Batman and Robin, and humiliation occurring from an unknown source, perhaps around the time my mother started spanking me and definitely after I discovered that people threw tomatoes and other trash at other people when they disapproved of something. (One of my earliest sex dreams involved a naked man caged outside a window as people threw tomatoes and trash at him. This scene part of a larger dream that also involved bondage and a female dominatrix, probably a mix between Supergirl’s looks and Poison Ivy’s seductive and powerful presence.) Of course, during this time I was not completely unaware of the differences between men and women and their interpersonal relationships. I knew boys had a “peepee” and that was something to tease them about. I remember a scene at the local pool’s women’s bathroom/changing room where I one day encountered a male classmate of mine and ran towards him, teasing him relentlessly about his penis (“I can see your peepee!”), only to slip and fall into a mosaicked divide between the showers. I ended up with an injury on the inside of my right foot and cried until my mother put a Band-Aid on it; but I also distinctly remember that I was more concerned about the scar and the Dora the Explorer Band-Aid afterwards than I was about the penis. That isn’t to say I wasn’t fascinated by it. As my mother showered me that day I couldn’t get the image of the tiny little penis out of my head, probably because it was the first time I had ever seen the infamous “peepee”; already at that age there was some sort of stigmatization behind this anatomical difference between males and females, even if we didn’t quite understand why. Speaking of anatomical differences, I had no idea that men ejaculated semen until my health class in 6th or 7th grade. Embarrassingly, I had no idea that women got wet until a couple years later when I was around 14 (8th grade). I provide this information to say that my body was not capable of producing fluids in a sexual way until I was about 14. And yet I masturbated, and yet I orgasmed. I felt no shame or guilt about sex and/or my sexuality throughout my life. I know I still don’t. But there is a deep sadness somewhere, wedged between all these other overwhelming feelings and complications. It is a sadness birthed from the fact that other people do suffer from this guilt and shame, and how sometimes they inflict the same guilt and shame in those around them. Isn’t that what a civilized society is supposed to do? Feel bad about sex? I shake my head. “That’s bullshit”, I say!"
